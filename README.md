## Numbers game
The numbers game consists of a player chosing to use 0-4 "high numbers" and the rest "small numbers" into a total of six numbers. The high numbers are drawn from the set [25, 50, 75, 100] and the small numbers are drawn from a set [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, ... , 9, 9, 10, 10], i.e. the numbers 1-10 with two copies of each. The six numbers are used together with the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to get as close to a target, in the range 100-999. You do not have to use all six numbers, each number may only be used once. The best player scores points; the correct answer is awarded ten, up to five away is awarded seven points and up to ten away is awarded five points.

To solve the numbers game, run the script numbers_game.sh (coming soon)
